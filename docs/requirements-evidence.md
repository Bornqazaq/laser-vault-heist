# Requirements and evidence

Statuses describe implementation evidence, not awarded points. **Local** means implemented and checked here; **External** means a TA/human condition remains. Visual quality is review-based, not a universal artifact-free guarantee. Paths are relative to the repository. Video timings refer to the final 3:30 demo. Detailed capture mapping is in [demo-coverage.md](demo-coverage.md).

## External assessment and delivery actions

The TA computer, exact course starter, native human keyboard/mouse usability, actual rehearsal, oral understanding and live defense remain unverified. The original course's classroom checkpoints, deadline, Moodle upload and TA invitation are human/organizational actions; no completion or grade is invented. The public repository and release are delivery artifacts, not proof of those conditions.
