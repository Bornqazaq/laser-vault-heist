## Verified locally

Clean Release build from a fresh clone; all three CTest suites pass. The portable ZIP passed CRC and file-hash checks and ran from a Unicode extraction path with an unrelated working directory. Its 40-second route run reached two safe-opening cycles without OpenGL errors. Original poses and all final document pages were visually reviewed; the complete MP4 decoded without errors.

Three uncapped 1280x720 runs on i5-13400F / RTX 5060 measured 1281.7, 1183.8 and 1215.8 average FPS. Raw frame times and method are included. These are whole-frame local measurements, not isolated GPU timings or a TA-machine guarantee.

## Remaining external checks

Native human keyboard/mouse usability, the unknown TA computer, exact course-starter compatibility, rehearsal and oral defense are not certified. No grade, classroom attendance, submission or live explanation is fabricated. See docs/requirements-evidence.md and docs/defense-guide.md.
